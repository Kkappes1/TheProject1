# TheProject1
Final Project For CISC

Description: The program depicted is a two-player tic-tac-toe game. The object of the game is to get your symbols (either X or O) in a consecutive three-row configuration. You can connect your symbols horizontally, vertically, or even diagonally. However, you also want to block your opponent from completing the same pattern. It is a game of strategy, Good Luck!

Instructions: The program will ask for your move and will switch players after each move is completed. To illustrate where you want your symbol to go (either X or O) you must enter the row and column number. The first row and column will start at 0. So if you wanted to put your symbol into the top left corner it would be input as 0 0. Simply put the intended row # followed by a space and then the column #. Furthermore, if you wanted to move to the middle square you would enter 1 1. Have Fun!
